# My Simpel Neural Network
This neural network was made with the help of the book "Make Your Own Neural Network".
The version I have created has been modified slightly to allow for more hidden layers.
Also the names of variables, methods, etc. has been changes as well.

## The "number_prediction.py" file
This file uses the mnist dataset (the handwritten numbers) to train the neural network to recognize hand written numbers.
It has a prediction accuracy of about 95-97% depending on whether you use 1 or 10 epochs.
The dataset to train the neural network can be downloaded from: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv
and the dataset to test the neural network can be downloaded from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.csv

## Limitations
This is my first actual neural network.
It lacks the option to change to different activation functions,
the ability to add bias neurons,
and the option to use a different amount of neurons in each hidden layer.
